#summary Hammock recycles in order to save the effort of reloading design documents on every use.

= Introduction =

The Repository and Query capabilities of Hammock require it to load (and update) your database's various design documents. In order to prevent this from occurring on each and every page request, Hammock provides a familiar connection pooling system to recycle your Session instances.

= Enabling Session Pooling =

Session pooling works automatically whenever you create a Session from a Connection:

{{{
var c = new Connection(new Uri("http://localhost:5984"));
var s = c.CreateSession();
}}}

You may then use the Session normally:

{{{
var u = s.Load<User>("user-foo");
u.SetPassword("bar");
s.Save(u);
}}}

When the Session is garbage collected by the runtime, manually disposed, or released using the Release() method, it will be returned to the Connection for reuse.

{{{
s.Release();
}}}

If you then request a new Session, you will actually receive a reference to the previously used Session.

{{{
// t and s now reference the same Session object
var t = c.CreateSession();
}}}

However you request the same User entity from the Session you will receive a _new_ reference.

{{{
// u and v are /different/ objects
var v = t.Load<User>("user-foo");
t.Save(u); // throws InvalidOperationException: u isn't enrolled in this Session anymore
t.Save(v); // works
}}}

= Controlling Session Lifecycle =

Sometimes you'll want to keep a Session from being recycled. The intended use case here is that a Session needs to be used for a long running task on a worker thread, and would otherwise be disposed (and therefore recycled) by the IoC that created it.

To prevent a Session from being recycled, take a Lock() on it. Lock returns an IDisposable. Until the IDisposable is disposed, the Session will not be recycled. Lock() uses an internal reference count, so you may take as many Lock()s as you wish, ensuring to Dispose() each returned object.

{{{
using (var s = c.CreateSession())
{
    var lok = s.Lock();
    new Thread(() => {
        try
        {
            // do long running work with session here.. s will not
            // be recycled, even after the using {} block exits.
        }
        finally
        {
            lok.Dispose();
        }
    }).Start();
}

}}}
